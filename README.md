# Homework 01: Code Refractor

## My Task

My task was to updated an existing website for a marketing agency and incorporate HTML 5 semantic elements to meet accessibility standards, optimize it for search engines, and improve the code base for long-term sustainability. All of these tasks should have been completed without altering the look or functionality of the website. 

My focus was on the source code, the structure of the HTML elements, the alt attributes associated with images, heading attributes and the title element, along with cleaning up the existing code.
