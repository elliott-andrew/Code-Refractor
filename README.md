# Code Refractor

## My Task

The required tasks were to update an existing website for a mock marketing agency and incorporate HTML 5 semantic elements to meet accessibility standards, optimize it for search engines, and improve the code base for long-term sustainability. These updates should not have altered the look or functionality of the website.

The focus was on the source code, the structure of the HTML elements, the alt attributes associated with images, heading attributes, the title element, and cleaning up the existing code.
